# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset

## Introduction
This project focuses on building and training a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits. Utilizing the MNIST dataset, one of the most popular datasets in the field of machine learning, this project demonstrates the basics of image processing and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Description
The MNIST handwriting dataset is a collection of 70,000 labeled images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale representation of a digit. This dataset is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## File Descriptions
- `ANN.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that includes the workflow of the project from data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- `layers.py`: A Python script containing custom neural network layers or functions that are imported and used in the `ANN.ipynb` notebook.

## Results
The results section should detail the performance of the model. This can include accuracy metrics, loss curves, and any insights gained from the training process. If you have visualizations or graphs, mention them here.
